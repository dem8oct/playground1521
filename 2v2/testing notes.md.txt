After opening the main link, it asked: What would you like to do? Create New Session or Join Existing Session

Create New Session button freezing on "Creating...Initializing session"
When refreshing the page: "Loading... Initializing session"
Sign Out button not working


Join as Guest button not working. End Session button not working!
The Sign Out button works, and logs me out. But the page stays the same.

----

  Test 1: Sign Out: it works.
  Test 2: Join as Guest: Join as Guest clicked" and I don't see the join form
  Test 3: Create Session: Creating session with user ID:
  Test 4: End Session: "Attempting to end session..." and "endSession called"

**Notes**:
1. Hard refresh => Loading... Initializing session
2. When Ending Session, it asks What would you like to do?
Then the Join Existing Session link works and the join session page loads!



When I click "Create Session", I see:
  - A green success toast saying "Session created! Join code: DX78KB".
  - Yes, it navigates to the Session Lobby automatically.

CreateSessionForm: Calling onSuccess callback
CreateSessionForm: onSuccess callback completed
CreateSessionForm: Setting loading to false


The Sign Out button works, and logs me out. But the session doesn't end!!!


Should we create a new branch for these fixes or stay on the same branch!
I think we should save our work now!

-----
Reminder!
1. I will leave Test the "Loading..." scenario: for later

----
Phase 5 testing notes:
1. In LOG MATCH page, when the user selects player 1 (e.g. David), then David should not appear in Player 2,3 & 4 dropdown lists! Though submitting with duplicate players failed and gave an error message 'Players cannot be selected more than once' ! So I want the 1st player name disappears from the other player fields! 2nd player and so on!
2. Club Name: should be mandatory and a dropdown list found in  Club_Name.md
3. Match Time: should log the form opening date and time. Hide this field.
4. After I clicked on Log Match button at the end of the form, the page stays the same!
5. Goals should be from 0-19 ONLY.
6. I see no form reset button!
 

**Restate my notes to make sure we understand each other!**
